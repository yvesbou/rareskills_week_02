- [ ] **Markdown file 3:** Revisit the solidity events tutorial. How can OpenSea quickly determine which NFTs an address owns if most NFTs donâ€™t use ERC721 enumerable? Explain how you would accomplish this if you were creating an NFT marketplace

By indexing the events from the smart contract of the NFT collection. Each time a NFT changes ownership (also with mint (transfer from 0x0 to recipient)) a transfer event get emitted.

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);

// inside _udpate call
emit Transfer(from, to, tokenId);
```

Indexing means filling up a database with the values of the event and the timestamp & number of the block such that the ordering of the transactions is clear (also store other info like tx hash etc.)

To know the set of owned NFTs I would filter for all tx including my target user, and check for each tokenId if the latest tx was a receiving tx (to is equal to my target address)

Either you build your indexer yourself (based on a client or a wrapper library) or you use an existing indexing service and pay for that service.
