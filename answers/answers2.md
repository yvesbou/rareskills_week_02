- [ ] **Markdown file 2:** Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

A simple ERC721 NFT can be wrapped using ERC721Wrapper e.g using the implementation from OZ and include many other features in the new contract, very straightforward every combination of the following implementations is possible:

ERC721Burnable
ERC721Consecutive
ERC721Enumerable
ERC721Pausable
ERC721Royalty
ERC721URIStorage
ERC721Votes

So the NFT can be used to create governance (ERC721Votes) to include Royalty, or introduce other mechanisms like being burnable or pausable.
